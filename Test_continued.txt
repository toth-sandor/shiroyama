And as history told the old ways go out in a blaze
Encircled by a vulture the end of ancient culture
The dawn of destiny draws near

Imperial force defied, facing 500 samurai
Surrounded and outnumbered
60 to 1, the sword face the gun
Bushido dignified
It's the last stand of the samurai
Surrounded and outnumbered
